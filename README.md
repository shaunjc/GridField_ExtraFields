# GridField_ExtraFields
Easily manage many_many_extraFields when adding objects to a ManyManyList via a GridField.

## TODO:
Create matching GridField_FormAction, GridFieldDataColumns, GridFieldConfig,
and/or GridFieldDetailForm to modify extra fields when objects have already
been linked to the Foreign Key, as well as an injector to use the new classes
by default.
